# Video Analysis Pipeline Documentation

## Overview

The Video Analysis Pipeline is a sophisticated system for analyzing video content through multiple dimensions: visual, auditory, and narrative. It leverages state-of-the-art deep learning models to extract meaningful insights from video content, breaking down a video into scenes, detecting entities, transcribing speech, identifying speakers, and providing rich semantic descriptions.

The pipeline processes videos through a sequential workflow of specialized components, each focusing on a specific aspect of video analysis. The end result is a comprehensive analysis report that describes the video's content, scenes, characters, objects, dialogue, and narrative structure.

## Core Components

### 1. Main Pipeline Orchestrator (`main.py`)

The `VideoPipeline` class in `main.py` serves as the central orchestrator that:
- Initializes all components with appropriate configuration
- Executes the processing steps in sequence
- Handles error conditions and provides fallbacks
- Aggregates results into a unified report
- Manages system resources (GPU/CPU usage, memory management)

The pipeline is typically run via `run_pipeline.py`, which sets up the proper CUDA environment variables before running the main pipeline.

## Pipeline Workflow

The pipeline processes a video through the following sequential steps:

### Step 1: Scene Detection
- The video is loaded and sampled at regular intervals
- Frame embeddings are computed using the CLIP model
- Initial scene boundaries are detected based on visual similarity
- Similar consecutive scenes are clustered based on semantic content
- Dialogue information is used to refine scene boundaries
- The result is a list of scenes with start/end times and frames

### Step 2: Keyframe Extraction
- For each detected scene, representative keyframes are extracted
- Content-based extraction selects frames that best represent the visual diversity
- Keyframes are saved to disk with metadata (frame index, timestamp, path)
- The output is a dictionary mapping scene indices to keyframe information

### Step 3: Entity Detection
- Each keyframe is processed with YOLOv5 to detect objects, people, etc.
- Detected entities are classified into semantic categories
- Results are organized by scene and keyframe
- The output includes bounding boxes, confidence scores, and semantic labels

### Step 4: Audio Processing
- Audio is extracted from the video using FFmpeg
- Speech is transcribed using WhisperX or alternative engines
- Speaker diarization identifies different speakers
- Dialogue is segmented, timestamped, and mapped to corresponding scenes
- The output includes scene-level dialogue with speaker identification

### Step 5: Scene Analysis with Gemini Vision
- Keyframes, entity data, and dialogue are sent to Gemini Vision API
- The model generates comprehensive scene descriptions
- Analysis covers setting, actions, characters, dialogue, cinematography, etc.
- Storylines and narrative connections between scenes are identified
- The output includes structured scene analysis and narrative flow information

### Step 6: Dialogue Enhancement
- Scenes with "UNKNOWN" speaker labels are identified
- Dialogue is processed in small batches to avoid response truncation
- Each batch is sent to Gemini API with scene context for character identification
- Multiple JSON parsing strategies handle various response formats
- Corrected dialogue is integrated back into the structured analysis
- Fallback identification is applied to any remaining unidentified speakers

### Step 7: Final Report Generation
- All component outputs are aggregated into a unified analysis
- Markdown report is generated with scene-by-scene breakdown
- Additional insights are derived:
  - Character appearances across scenes
  - Recurring objects and their significance
  - Narrative structure and storylines
  - Setting changes and continuity
- Structured JSON data is also saved for programmatic use
